# **React MadLibs**
-------

Make a Madlibs game in React!

You will need a form for your Madlib, which, once submitted, shows the story with the form entries inserted.

You should have a top-level ***Madlib*** component, but beyond that the component hierarchy is up to you. Diagram out the hierarchy for yourself before you write any code! Please do not use a single React component.

**Document your code appropriately.**

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
